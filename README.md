# Geomapping_Leaflet
Visualize earthquake data from the USGS website


A Leaflet map that shows earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website, by longitude and latitude.
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change.

#### Data: 
The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and pick a data set to visualize. For this project, a JSON representation of the data that includes 'All Earthquakes with a magnitude of 2+ from the Past 7 Days' is pulled. The URL of this JSON is used to pull in the data for our visualization.

The result looks similar to this:
